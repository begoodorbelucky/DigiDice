## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals
- Successfully launch the "Digi Dice" website featuring a homepage, a 'dice' page with a functional rolling dice, and a contact page.
- Design an intuitive and visually appealing website interface that enhances user experience and encourages easy navigation.
- Ensure the website is fully responsive on all screen sizes, with a focus on mobile first design, providing a seamless and enjoyable experience on all devices.
- Create a user-friendly interface for rolling dice.
- This project targets gamers, tabletop RPG enthusiasts, and anyone who needs a virtual dice rolling tool.

### Color Scheme
